# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a basic Bash script that calculates simple interest based on user input for principal, rate, and time.

## ðŸ“œ Description

This project is part of the final Git and GitHub hands-on assignment. It contains a simple shell script (`simple-interest.sh`) that prompts the user to enter:

- Principal amount
- Rate of interest
- Time period

And then calculates the simple interest using the formula:

* Simple Interest = (Principal Ã— Rate Ã— Time) / 100
